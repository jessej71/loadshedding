  <title>Load Shedding in South Africa</title>

<body>
  <h2>Data driven investigating of an energy crisis in South Africa</h2>
  <p>South African state run electricity provider <a href="https://www.eskom.co.za/">Eskom</a> cuts power to predetermined locations when demand exceeds supply. This is called load shedding and has led to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_energy_crisis#:~:text=The%20South%20African%20energy%20crisis,and%20continues%20to%20the%20present.">energy crisis</a>. In Figure 1, the impact for the last decade is shown in terms of the the monthly average of daily power cuts experienced by South Africans.</p>

  <p> <a href="https://www.news24.com/fin24/Economy/Eskom/breaking-eskom-moves-to-stage-6-load-shedding-20191209">Some suggest</a> severe load shedding is explained by extreme precipitation events. The hypothesis would be that <b><i>because much of South Africa's energy is produced by coal that can become water saturated and not burn well, heavy rains lower energy production</i></b>. To test this, Figure 2 plots power interuptions vs precipitation.</p>
